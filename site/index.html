	<p>Though the direct origins of the Kaiju that have started to impede on our world is yet unknown, their methods for accessing our world have been discovered. Inter-dimensional doorways appear to be giving these beings access to our world. These doorways, or "Breaches", allow the kaiju through at exponential rates.

	<p>Though research into the Kaiju is still in its infancy it has been found that they are silicon-based life forms. There are theories that they are manufactured soldiers being sent by some higher life form but those theories are simply conjecture at this point. What we do know is that they are large, predatory creatures that contain secondary brains, enlarged hearts and acidic base biological conditions. Were they to attempt to inhabit out planet on a long term they would mainly be aquatic animals coming to shore to feed.

<p>The proposal of a program that would allow us to bring the fight to them is under development. The Jaeger Program has made large strides towards leveling out the fight against the Kaiju who are destroying our cities. Soon, the Mach 1 Jaegers and their first even pilots will be deployed. They are our best hope at defending our planet.
